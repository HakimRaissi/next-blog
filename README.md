# NEXTJS - Blog

## About the project

### Description

This is a very basic blog application that I built to learn nextJS and GraphCMS. For those who haven't noticed, it is inspired by [DEV](https://dev.to/)

Thanks to [Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin) from [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptMastery) for his amazing free courses, it helped me a lot to wrap my head around graphCMS and Nextjs

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/)
